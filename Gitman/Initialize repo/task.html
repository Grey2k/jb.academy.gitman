<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>A new program starts with a new repository, where you keep the code and history of changes. You'll create a repository with one file. You don't need to know the programming language of the given program. All you should focus on now is the git commands.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>First, initialize an empty git repository inside the <em>repository</em> folder, and add the <em>main.py</em> file to it. Commit the file to the main branch with the commit message: <code class="language-python">Hello, world</code>.</p>
<p>The content of the file should be the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Helo, worlld!")</code></pre>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary">We have some typos in our initial version of the program. Have you ever heard of bugs? However, even if you want to fix these typos right now, be patient, we'll fix them later.</div>
<p>You can use the <code class="language-python">git config --global init.defaultBranch main</code> command to set <code class="language-python">main</code> as the default branch in your system settings.</p>
<p><button class="btn-sm btn-outline-secondary" onclick="getElementById('hint-1069').style.display='inline'">
        Hint
      </button>
</p><div id="hint-1069" style="display:none;">If you want to start over, delete the <em>.git</em> directory.</div>
