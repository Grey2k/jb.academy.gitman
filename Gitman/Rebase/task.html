<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>For now, we don't have any new features for the development, so we can finish the work and apply the changes to the <code class="language-bash">main</code> branch. Keep in mind that it's important to preserve the history of commits in the <code class="language-bash">main</code>. You can do it through the <strong>merge</strong> or <strong>rebase</strong>. You've already tried the merge operation, so let's get acquainted with rebase.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>This stage requires the exact sequence of git commands, but you can always abort the rebase and try the task again with the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git rebase --abort</code></pre>
<p>First, go to the <code class="language-bash">develop</code> branch and start the rebase to main with this command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git rebase main</code></pre>
<p>Oops! It seems that git has problems with auto-merging the <em>main.py</em> file and warns you about it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in main.py</code></pre>
<p>Open the <em>main.py</em> in an editor and alter the content. You should keep the call to the main function, and the printing of <code class="language-bash">Hello, world!</code> to the terminal.</p>
<p>Then add the file to the git index (staging area) and continue the rebase:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git rebase --continue</code></pre>
<p>Now, your task is finished.</p>
