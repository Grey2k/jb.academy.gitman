<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>This program may seem pretty simple if you have any programming experience, but why not share it though? Let's create a GitHub repository and push our <code class="language-bash">main</code> branch to it! When you've finished, you can continue to work on the program by yourself or encourage your friends to send pull-requests with new features.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>Now, let's go back to the <code class="language-bash">main</code> branch. Merge the <code class="language-bash">develop</code> branch to the <code class="language-bash">main</code>. After you finish all the operations, you'll have the same history of commits in both the <code class="language-bash">main</code> and <code class="language-bash">develop</code> branches. The history stays clean, and you can follow it with the command <code class="language-bash">git log</code> if you are curious enough!</p>
<p>It's time to create a <a href="https://github.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a> account if you don't have one already. Create a new repository in your account, and do not add any additional files like README; you can do it later if you want.</p>
<p>After you create an empty repository, run this command in your terminal, where <code class="language-bash">&lt;your_username&gt;</code> is your nickname in Github, and <code class="language-bash">&lt;your_repository&gt;</code> is the name of the repository you've created:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git remote add origin https://github.com/&lt;your_username&gt;/&lt;your_repository&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The code snippet below shows you how to push your local repository to the remote. Tests won't check this part, but we strongly recommend you publish your repo to a public resource to practice it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git push -u origin main</code></pre>
<p>That's it. From now on, you can use the git + GitHub bundle for all your projects. It makes the development in distributed teams easier and helps you keep the history of changes made to the code.</p>
