<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>While working on the newer version of the program, we can still make urgent changes to the main branch if needed. As you might remember, we had some typos in the <code class="language-python">main</code> branch. The work on the <code class="language-python">develop</code> branch may last a long time, so let's make a hotfix for this problem.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>Start the task by creating a new branch from the <code class="language-python">main</code><em>,</em> and name it <code class="language-python">hotfix/no-more-typos</code>. Alter the content of the <em>main.py</em> file again:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Hello, world!")</code></pre>
<p>When you fix the file, merge the hotfix branch to the main to have a good clean version of your code in the main branch. The commit message should be <code class="language-python">Fix typos</code>.</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-warning">Note that you should create a new branch from the <code class="language-python">main</code> branch, not from the <code class="language-python">develop</code> branch. </div>
